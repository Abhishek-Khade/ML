("Age_08_04","KM","HP","cc","Doors","Gears","Quarterly_Tax","Weight")

Que. 2

Refer the “Engine.csv” and observe the dataset and decide type of Regression.
Datasets provide fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.
Predict the Co2emission for with given fuel consumption ratings CYLINDERS, ENGINESIZE, FUELCONSUMPTION_COMB.
Calculate different errors to evaluate the model.

Que. 3
Calculate different evaluation metrics for model builded in assignmnet 6.
